I've only been to a handful of conferences, most in Tulsa, OK the others in Austin, TX. Living in
the OKC area, I was thrilled to hear news of the first ever [Thunder Plains conference][tp] starting
last year. I've attended this conference and I recommend you check it out.

Thunder Plains was started by the co-founders of [OKC.js][okcjs], Jesse Harlin and Vance Lucas. They're
good guys who have given a lot to the local developer community. I suspect OKC.js has become a large
community not because of the demand for JavaScript (JS) programmers or more programmers are learning
JS but more because the environment makes you want to want to learn JS. (No that was not a typo.)

This conference gives off the same vibe. You'll learn new things but in case you're really a big shot
(why are you reading my blog?), you'll have a hard time being bored as there are smart and friendly
folks to discuss sorting algorithms over pizza.

If you do decide to attend the next Thunder Plains conference, I also recommend sticking around
for the after party. Last year they had a taco bar, Amanaguchi music, and Nintendo 64 and tabletop
games.

<p class="text-info">I'd like to add an honorable mention to Amanda Harlin. Being Jesse's wife
and a fellow developer, she pitches in a lot... especially with implementing her husband's
ideas.</p>
